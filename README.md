## Logistics

- Make sure everyone has a way to work on this codebase, with a common set of tools.
- Everyone should make code contributions to the repository (i.e. everyone should have some commits in the project log)

## Assignment Milestones

1. [Part 1 README will be released first.](./part1_README.md)
2. [Part 2 README will be released shortly after](./part2_README.md)
3. [Part 3 README will be released after part 2](./part3_README.md)

The assignment (part 1, part 2, and part 3) are all due together when Assignment 2 is released.

Think of each part as a project milestone for a final deliverable. Stay on track!
